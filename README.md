# Morse Battle
Morse Battle is a remake of simple and classic space shuttle game, but you control the shuttle to fire using morse code.

## How to Play

- Aim the Shuttle
    - Tap <Space> to input morse code <dot>
    - Long press <Space> to input morse code <dash>
- Use <Arrow> keys to move the shuttle around

PS: Remember to use your friend's keyboard. :)

## To deploy

I used the [js import syntax], so simply open index.html will not start the app.
